Red John
========

The finale of Season 5 of [The Mentalist](http://www.cbs.com/shows/the_mentalist/) revealed the [seven final suspects](http://www.cbs.com/shows/the_mentalist/red-john/) that could be [Red John](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_John). With Season 6 in full bloom, this is an attempt to try and see who the general public thinks Red John is.

Check out the [live demo](http://redjohn.herokuapp.com/static/index.html) of the work done so far.
