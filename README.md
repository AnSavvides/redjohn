Red John
=======

A project using two lovely python libraries, namely [tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy) and [pymongo](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymongo/), aimed at gathering all [Red John](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_John)-related tweets.

The finale of Season 5 of [The Mentalist](http://www.cbs.com/shows/the_mentalist/) revealed the [seven final suspects](http://www.cbs.com/shows/the_mentalist/red-john/) that could be Red John. With Season 6 about to begin in less than a week, this is an attempt to try and see who the general public thinks Red John is.

The next step will be to visualise the data gathered, to see how people's opinions fluctuate over time and how they react to new events and clues revealed at each step of the way towards revealing who Red John is.
