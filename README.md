Red John
========

The finale of Season 5 of [The Mentalist](http://www.cbs.com/shows/the_mentalist/) revealed the [seven final suspects](http://www.cbs.com/shows/the_mentalist/red-john/) that could be [Red John](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_John). With Season 6 in full bloom during the months of September to November, this was an attempt to try and see who the general public thought Red John was over time using data from Twitter.

You can see the outcome of this project [here](http://redjohn.herokuapp.com/static/index.html), but please keep in mind this contains some major spoilers so don't click unless you've already watched The Mentalist to the point that you know who Red John is!
